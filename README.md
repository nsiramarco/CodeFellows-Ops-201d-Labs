## ***Favorite Ops Challenge assignment:***

My Favorite Ops Challenge is Ch13 which is to create a script that asks a user to type a domain, then displays information about the typed domain.
    - The reason I like this Ops Challenge is because I am curious about webpages somtimes to see the domain ownership, trademark infringement, the security such as a SSL certificate installed, and also technical information such as ip address and who the domain is registered with. 

## ***How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?***

These examples learned in Ops 201 can be beneficial i the work enviroment in roles such as system administration, Cloud Comuting , data analysis and more.The shell scripts can be used for software updates, routine tasks, generate reports, troubleshoot concerns and manage user account amoung many more configurations.

## ***What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?***

I would like to continue to expand my knowledge in bash and powershell

## ***What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?***

I would like to have my scripts to be more optimized and efficient to have better performance and the usability of my scripts. Also having better debugging and error handling  to fix based on input and output
